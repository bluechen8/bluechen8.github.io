Hello :)
My name is Boru Chen ["陈博儒"]. I am a Ph.D. student at the University of California Berkeley, working with [Professor Christopher Fletcher](http://cwfletcher.net/). I have broad interests in computer security. For now, my work concentrates on micro-architecture vulnerabilities.

Before coming to the bay area, I spent two years at UIUC. I had my B.E. degree in Automation at Zhejiang University, China.
